# QRCode-Server
Reads qr-codes, show the data: this is server side


**This project consists two repositoris** 

* QRCode-Scanner, contains "scanner-side" (this repo)
* QRCode-Server, contains "server-side"

Notes: I use same environment for these two repos

QRCode-scanner use OpenCV2 with GPU support, all scanned qr-codes will be shown in a box with respective data on it. There is only two qr-code types: 
1. Registered qr-code will shown the data (username, full name, address, scanned location
2. Unregistered qr-code will be appeared as "Tidak terdaftar"
   
However, unfortunately this is just prototype so it comes without admin dashboard whatsoever. 

Oke thats all hope you find something useful
